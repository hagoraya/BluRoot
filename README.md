## About

This code runs a function that calls the github search API to get a group of 10 users from a location, then stores the users in the database if they not already exist. 

## Tech Stack
This code is written in Node.js. It uses axios to make a fetch request to Github's API, and
Mongoose.js to create a user schema and to interact with MongoDB.

## Usage

```
npm install
node main.js
```
